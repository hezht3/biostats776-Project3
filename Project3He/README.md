# Project3He

The `Project3He` package is built for assignment of Project 3 of 140.776 Statistical Computing.

## Installation

You can directly install the source package with:

```R
install.packages("#Path of the source package")
```



If you meet with issues directly installing the source package, please add the following arguments:

```R
install.packages("#Path of the source package", repos = NULL, type="source")
```



There is also a version on GitHub which can be installed via:

```
devtools::install_github("hezht3/Project3He")
```

Since the due of the assignment has not passed yet, I currently change the repository to "private assess", but please do contact me at <zhe33@jhu.edu> if there is any issue with the package installation, and I can change the repository access to allow installation from GitHub.



Thank you!
